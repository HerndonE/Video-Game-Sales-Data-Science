# Video Game Sales with Ratings

# Introduction
It has been a ongoing question on what makes a best selling game? In this report we will go through the 
processes of attaining, cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling data to explore this question. This will require 
data exploration, visualization, and different machine learning methods including classification and cluster analysis. 
The data set we will be working and exploring with contains information about video game sales in different regions. Our goal 
is to predict Japan sales based on the genre, platform, and publisher.
